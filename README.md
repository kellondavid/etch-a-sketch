Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch assignment

General thoughts:
This was definitely the most difficult TOP assignment. I had no idea how to make a grid, so that took a lot of googling and time, but I was able to learn a lot by doing so. The project also had to be in mostly DOM manipulation, which made it a lot more challenging. Color picker also took a while, and although it was not necessary, I figured it was a good tool to learn for the future. I also had an issue where if you click on a grid block that has already been colored in, the mouse cursor will show as "not permitted." To fix this issue, I added "e.preventDefault();" under my onmousedown event function. Overall, fun assignment that encourages you to utilize everything that you have learend up to this point.

What I learned:
  - how to utilize DOM manipulation
  - how to make a grid and change its size
  - how to create a color picker and color buttons
  - how to use mousedown + mousehover eventlisteners
  - how to use mediaquery for responsive web design
  - learned the purpose of e.preventDefault()
