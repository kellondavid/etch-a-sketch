Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch assignment

General thoughts:
This was definitely the most challenging TOP assignment. I had no idea how to make a grid, so that took a lot of googling and time, but I was able to learn a lot by doing so. Colorpicker also took a while, and although it was not necessary, I figured it was a good tool to learn for the future. Overall, fun assignment that forces you to utilize everyting that you have learend up to this point.

What I learned:
  - how to make a grid and change its size
  - how to create a colorpicker and color buttons
  - how to use mousedown + mousehover eventlisteners
